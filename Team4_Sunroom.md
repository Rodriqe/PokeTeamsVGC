## Team overview

A dedicated **Sun + Trick Room (“Sunroom”)** build that can pivot between speed control modes depending on the matchup:
- **Trick Room mode**: Hatterene/Farigiraf set Trick Room while Amoonguss supports with redirection and sleep; Torkoal and Iron Hands clean under TR.
- **Sun/Tailwind mode**: Roaring Moon provides Tailwind and strong immediate pressure; Torkoal still benefits from Sun even outside Trick Room.

## Roles & key notes

### Torkoal
Primary sun setter and main Trick Room sweeper. **Quiet 0 Spe** maximizes under-speeding for Trick Room mirrors and boosts Eruption damage by moving as late as possible.

### Hatterene
Trick Room setter with Magic Bounce utility. **Quiet 0 Spe** for TR speed control, with Protect to preserve Life Orb longevity.

### Farigiraf
Secondary Trick Room setter and key utility vs priority thanks to Armor Tail. **Sassy 0 Spe** and bulk EVs help it reliably get Trick Room up and then enable allies via Helping Hand.

### Amoonguss
Redirection + Spore glue. **Sassy 0 Spe** for Trick Room, with Pollen Puff for healing and chip. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves into Rage Powder.

### Iron Hands
Bulky physical pivot and under-TR attacker. **Assault Vest means no Protect**; moves are standard VGC coverage with Fake Out support. **Brave 0 Spe** for Trick Room performance.

### Roaring Moon
Fast mode enabler with Tailwind and strong physical pressure. **Keep Jolly** to maximize speed in non-Trick Room lines; Booster Energy gives immediate tempo.

## Common leads

- **Hatterene + Amoonguss**: safest Trick Room line (Rage Powder + Trick Room).
- **Farigiraf + Iron Hands**: priority denial + Fake Out to force Trick Room or apply pressure.
- **Roaring Moon + Torkoal**: Tailwind option that still leverages Sun pressure.

## General game plan

1. Identify whether you win with **Trick Room** (slower teams / bulky balances) or **Tailwind** (faster offenses / teams that deny TR).
2. Use **Amoonguss** to buy turns (Rage Powder/Spore) so your setters can establish speed control.
3. Once speed control is set, convert with **Torkoal Eruption** and **Iron Hands** damage while protecting setters and cycling Amoonguss with Regenerator.

## Optional adjustments

- Torkoal: consider **Yawn** over Earth Power for additional turn control.
- Farigiraf: **Foul Play** over Hyper Voice for opposing physical setup, if desired.
- Roaring Moon: **Taunt** over Knock Off if you need more anti-setup/anti-TR.
